# Intercom Events
Chrome extension to easily track sales funnel events in Intercom. 

1.) Enter your Intercom App and API Keys in the appropriate text boxes, these will only need to be entered once (get keys here --> https://doc.intercom.io/api/#authorization)

2.) Enter a comma separated list of sales funnel events you would like to track (sales_call, p10, p50, etc.) in the "Intercom Events" text box, this will only need to be entered once and will automatically generate the appropriate buttons

3.) Go to the users page in Intercom that you would like to track an event for (e.g. https://app.intercom.io/a/apps/riqa7aqp/users/558b3dd759421be924001acb)

4.) Open the Intercom Event Chrome Extension and click the appropriate event button, refresh the page, and you will see your new event in the "Activity" section

Now you will easily be able to create a report that better tracks how users are moving through your sales funnel by doing interval reporting on the date/time of each of these events!
